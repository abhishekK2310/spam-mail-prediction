## How To Use 🚀

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/abhishekK2310/spam-mail-prediction.git](https://github.com/abhishekK2310/spam-mail-prediction.git)
    ```

## Model 🤖

The project uses a **Logistic Regression** model, which is a binary classifier that is well-suited for text classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails to learn the patterns that distinguish spam from non-spam emails.

---

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used for training the model is included in the repository (`mail_data.csv`). It contains a collection of emails that have been labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
